# ConnectFour
Simple GUI based ConnectFour game with the option to play against AI

Known Bugs:

- If the user clicks while the computer is thinking it can stop the AI from running and change the user to player 2. It can also cause the AI to run in an infinite loop freezing the game.
- Errors with the sound.


Want to fix/add/change:

- Better scheme for AI so that it makes more intelligent decisions
- Logging of all activity
- There is likely a better way to check if moving in a certain column will give X number of pieces in a row (with open spaces in the middle or round it)
- Likely a better way to perform animations (have them run in the background)
- AI should be able to be player 1 or player 2 (as of now only player 2)
- Add documentation
