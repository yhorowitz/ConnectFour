# ConnectFour
GUI based ConnectFour game with the option to play against multiple AI difficulties

Want to fix/add/change:

- Better scheme for AI so that it makes more intelligent decisions
- Logging of all activity
- There is likely a better way to check if moving in a certain column will give X number of pieces in a row (with open spaces in the middle or round it)
- Likely a better way to perform animations (have them run in the background)
- Add documentation
