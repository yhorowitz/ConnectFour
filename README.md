# ConnectFour
GUI based ConnectFour game with the option to play against multiple AI difficulties

Want to fix/add/change:

- Continue changing heuristic for AI so that it makes more intelligent decisions (ie. give scores for disjointed tokens as well as for 2 in a row and 1 token with empty spaces)
- Logging of all activity
- Likely a better way to perform animations (have them run in the background)
- Add documentation
